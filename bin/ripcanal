# version 0.5
# regexes didn't recognize capital letters (HD and MP4)
# version 0.4
# change output filename extension from original mp4 to flv. Transcoded file
# is not an mp4 file.
# version 0.3
# - simplified a regex:
# cat $xml_file|\
#   sed "s/</\n</gi"|\
#   sed "s/>/>\n/gi"\
#   > $xml_file
# cat $xml_file|\
#   sed -E "s/(<[^>]*>)/\n\1\n/g"
#   > $xml_file
#   
# version 0.2
# - fixed a bug where a video wouldn't be found because the video name
#   can be video_H or video_HD
# version 0.1
# - initial version

# This script downloads a video from the canal+ website by manipulating
# a given URL in the form:
#   http://www.canalplus.fr/../pid1830-c-zapping.html?vid=743320
#
# It is intended so far to work only with "Le zapping". Might work for
# other videos.
#
# Pieces of information about the video are stored in a XML file
# on the canal+ website. The URL of the video flux is in this file.
# The name of this XML file is the same as the vid argument
# at the end of the URL of the webpage where we would watch the video
# if we were using a browser.
#
# The generic xml file URL:
#   http://service.canal-plus.com/video/rest/getVideos/cplus/
#
# We download this XML file to extract the video URL which is a RTMP flux.
#
# We then use rtmpdump.exe to transcode and save the video to the local
# filesytem.
